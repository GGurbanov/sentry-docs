To capture all errors, you should initialize the Sentry React Native SDK as soon as possible.

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:App.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-7", "profiling": "8-12"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

#### Wrap Your App

Wrap your app with Sentry to automatically instrument it with [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/touchevents/) and [automatic performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/):

```javascript {filename:App.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

You do not need to do this for Sentry to work or if your app does not have a single parent "App" component.
