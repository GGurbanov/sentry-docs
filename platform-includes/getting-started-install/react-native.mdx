Run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -s -i reactNative
```

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [set up manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then you can add the patched files to your version control system.
The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard:

- Install the `@sentry/react-native` package.
- Enable the Sentry React Native Gradle build step for Android to auto-upload generated source maps and debug symbols.
- Wrap the _Bundle React Native code and images_ Xcode project build phase script to upload generated source maps and collect bundled node modules.
- Add _Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry_ Xcode project build phase.
- Run `pod install`.
- Store build credentials in _*ios/sentry.properties*_ and _*android/sentry.properties*_.
- Configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your _*App.tsx*_ file.

### Expo

If you're using Expo, [read our docs](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/expo/) to learn how to add Sentry to your Expo project. This SDK will work for both managed and bare projects.
