On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.flutter') }}
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
      // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
      options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );

  // or define SENTRY_DSN via Dart environment variable (--dart-define)
}
```

You can configure the `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`, `SENTRY_DIST` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` via the Dart environment variables passing the `--dart-define` flag to the compiler as noted in the code sample.
