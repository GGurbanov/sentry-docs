If you prefer to follow video instructions, see [How to Install the Sentry Python SDK in 60 Seconds](https://vimeo.com/899368672).

<Note>

Version 2.0 of the Sentry Python SDK is now available. If you're looking to upgrade from 1.x, check out the <PlatformLink to="/migration/1.x-to-2.x/">migration guide</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-7", "profiling": "8-11"}}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Verify

Add this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

<Note>

Not seeing your error in Sentry? Make sure you're running the above example from a file and not from a Python shell like IPython.
