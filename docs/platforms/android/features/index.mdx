<Note>

Sentry's Android SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application.

</Note>

- The Native Development Kit (NDK), the set of tools that that allows you to use C and C++ code with Android, is packed with the SDK.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/android/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once the application is restarted
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for:
  - Android activity lifecycle events
  - Application lifecycle events (lifecycle of the application process)
  - System events (low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, shutdown, changes of the configuration, and so forth)
  - App. component callbacks
  - User Interactions (view click, scroll, swipe, etc.)
  - Android fragment lifecycle events with [Fragment Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/)
  - OkHttp requests with [OkHttp Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/)
  - Apollo requests with [Apollo Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/)
  - Timber logs with [Timber Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/timber/)
  - Navigation destination changes with [Navigation Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/)
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/android/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/android/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions for:
    - Android activity transactions
    - User interaction transactions (view click, scroll, swipe, and so on)
    - Navigation transactions with [Navigation Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/)
    - Android fragment spans with [Fragment Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/)
    - [Cold and warm app start](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation)
    - [Slow and frozen frames](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames)
    - OkHttp request spans with [OkHttp Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/)
    - SQLite and Room query spans with [Room and SQLite Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/room-and-sqlite/)
    - File I/O spans with [File I/O Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/file-io/)
    - Apollo request spans with [Apollo Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/)
    - Distributed tracing through [OkHttp](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/) and [Apollo](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/) integrations
- [Application Not Responding (ANR)](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/) reported if the application is blocked for more than five seconds
- [HTTP Client Errors](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/#http-client-errors)
- [Screenshot attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/screenshots/)
- [View Hierarchy attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/)
- Code samples provided in both Kotlin and Java as the Android SDK uses both languages
- We provide a [sample application](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-android) for our Android users
