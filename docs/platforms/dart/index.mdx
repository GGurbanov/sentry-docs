On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart') }}
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<SignInNote />

```dart {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-8"}}
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init((options) {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
  });

  // or define SENTRY_DSN via Dart environment variable (--dart-define)
}
```

You can configure the `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`, `SENTRY_DIST`, and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` via the Dart environment variables passing the `--dart-define` flag to the compiler, as noted in the code sample.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

try {
  aMethodThatMightFail();
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  await Sentry.captureException(
    exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
  );
}
```

<Note>
